# hello-python
Very simple hello world python Flask application.

## Containerizing an application

### Create a Dockerfile

### Create an image

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t hello-python:latest .

```
This will perform those seven steps listed in Dockerfile to create the image. To verify the image was created, run the following command:

```
docker image ls
```

### Running in Docker

Before jumping into Kubernetes, letâ€™s verify it works in Docker. Run the following command to have Docker run the application in a container and map it to port 5001:

```
docker run -p 5001:5000 hello-python
```

#### This launch application on : http://localhost:5001/

Now lets jump to kubernetes. 

Go to folder /kubernetes. Here we have deployment.yaml

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Getting the localhost. Checl the services which are launched.
```
kubectl get all
```

In the image above we see that service is launched at port 31709. So run the following link to run python app on kubenetes.

http://localhost:31709/
